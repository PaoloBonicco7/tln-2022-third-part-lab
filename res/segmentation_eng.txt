Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. 
The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies.
The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.
Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 metres, weights between 100 and 270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, 
depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour and some other 
minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild. The oldest gorilla ever is Fatou (b. 1957), who is still alive at the advanced age of 65 years.
Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of 
elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft). 
Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland 
gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.
There are thought to be around 316,000 western gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas. 
Both species are classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN; all subspecies are classified as Critically Endangered with the 
exception of the mountain gorilla, which is classified as Endangered. There are many threats to their survival, such as poaching, 
habitat destruction, and disease, which threaten the survival of the species. However, conservation efforts have been successful 
in some areas where they live.
The word "gorilla" comes from the history of Hanno the Navigator (c. 500 BC), a Carthaginian explorer on an expedition to the west African coast to the area that later became Sierra 
Leone.[1][2] Members of the expedition encountered "savage people, the greater part of whom were women, whose bodies were hairy, and whom our interpreters called Gorillae".[3][4] 
It is unknown whether what the explorers encountered were what we now call gorillas, another species of ape or monkeys, or humans.[5] Skins of gorillai women, brought back by Hanno,
are reputed to have been kept at Carthage until Rome destroyed the city 350 years later at the end of the Punic Wars, 146 BC.
The American physician and missionary Thomas Staughton Savage and naturalist Jeffries Wyman first described the western gorilla in 1847 from specimens obtained in Liberia.[6] They called 
it Troglodytes gorilla, using the then-current name of the chimpanzee genus. The species name was derived from Ancient Greek Γόριλλαι (gorillai)  'tribe of hairy women',[7] as described by Hanno.
Wild male gorillas weigh 136 to 227 kg (300 to 500 lb), while adult females weigh 68–113 kg (150–250 lb).[16][17] Adult males are 1.4 to 1.8 m (4 ft 7 in to 5 ft 11 in) tall, with an arm span that
 stretches from 2.3 to 2.6 m (7 ft 7 in to 8 ft 6 in). Female gorillas are shorter at 1.25 to 1.5 m (4 ft 1 in to 4 ft 11 in), with smaller arm spans.[18][19][20][21] Colin Groves (1970) calculated 
 the average weight of 42 wild adult male gorillas at 144 kg, while Smith and Jungers (1997) found the average weight of 19 wild adult male gorillas to be 169 kg.[22][23] Adult male gorillas are known 
 as silverbacks due to the characteristic silver hair on their backs reaching to the hips. The tallest gorilla recorded was a 1.95 m (6 ft 5 in) silverback with an arm span of 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in), a 
 chest of 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in), and a weight of 219 kg (483 lb), shot in Alimbongo, northern Kivu in May 1938.[21] The heaviest gorilla recorded was a 1.83 m (6 ft 0 in) silverback shot in Ambam, Cameroon, 
 which weighed 267 kg (589 lb).[21] Males in captivity can be overweight and reach weights up to 310 kg (683 lb).[21]
Western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei)
The eastern gorilla is more darkly coloured than the western gorilla, with the mountain gorilla being the darkest of all. The mountain gorilla also has the thickest hair. The western lowland gorilla
 can be brown or greyish with a reddish forehead. In addition, gorillas that live in lowland forest are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorillas. The eastern gorilla also has a longer 
 face and broader chest than the western gorilla.[24] Like humans, gorillas have individual fingerprints.[25][26] Their eye colour is dark brown, framed by a black ring around the iris. Gorilla facial 
 structure is described as mandibular prognathism, that is, the mandible protrudes farther out than the maxilla. Adult males also have a prominent sagittal crest.
Gorillas move around by knuckle-walking, although they sometimes walk upright for short distances, typically while carrying food or in defensive situations. A 2018 study investigating the hand posture 
of 77 mountain gorillas at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (8% of the population) found that knuckle walking was done only 60% of the time, and they also supported their weight on their fists, the 
backs of their hands/feet, and on their palms/soles (with the digits flexed). Such a range of hand postures was previously thought to have been used by only orangutans.[27] Studies of gorilla handedness 
have yielded varying results, with some arguing for no preference for either hand, and others right-hand dominance for the general population.[28]
Studies have shown gorilla blood is not reactive to anti-A and anti-B monoclonal antibodies, which would, in humans, indicate type O blood. Due to novel sequences, though, it is different enough to not 
conform with the human ABO blood group system, into which the other great apes fit.[29]
A gorilla's lifespan is normally between 35 and 40 years, although zoo gorillas may live for 50 years or more. Colo, a female western gorilla at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, was the oldest known 
gorilla at 60 years of age when she died on 17 January 2017.[30] Ozzie was 61 years old at the time of his death in January 2022.[31]
Gorillas live in groups called troops. Troops tend to be made of one adult male or silverback, with a harem of multiple adult females and their offspring.[48][49][50] However, multiple-male troops 
also exist.[49] A silverback is typically more than 12 years of age, and is named for the distinctive patch of silver hair on his back, which comes with maturity. Silverbacks have large canine teeth
that also come with maturity. Both males and females tend to emigrate from their natal groups. For mountain gorillas, females disperse from their natal troops more than males.[48][51] Mountain gorillas
and western lowland gorillas also commonly transfer to second new groups.[48]
Mature males also tend to leave their groups and establish their own troops by attracting emigrating females. However, male mountain gorillas sometimes stay in their natal troops and become subordinate 
to the silverback. If the silverback dies, these males may be able to become dominant or mate with the females. This behaviour has not been observed in eastern lowland gorillas. In a single male group, 
when the silverback dies, the females and their offspring disperse and find a new troop.[51][52] Without a silverback to protect them, the infants will likely fall victim to infanticide. Joining a new 
group is likely to be a tactic against this.[51][53] However, while gorilla troops usually disband after the silverback dies, female eastern lowlands gorillas and their offspring have been recorded staying 
together until a new silverback transfers into the group. This likely serves as protection from leopards.[52]
Silverback gorilla
The silverback is the centre of the troop's attention, making all the decisions, mediating conflicts, determining the movements of the group, leading the others to feeding sites, and taking responsibility 
for the safety and well-being of the troop. Younger males subordinate to the silverback, known as blackbacks, may serve as backup protection. Blackbacks are aged between 8 and 12 years[50] and lack the silver
 back hair. The bond that a silverback has with his females forms the core of gorilla social life. Bonds between them are maintained by grooming and staying close together.[54] Females form strong relationships 
 with males to gain mating opportunities and protection from predators and infanticidal outside males.[55] However, aggressive behaviours between males and females do occur, but rarely lead to serious injury. 
 Relationships between females may vary. Maternally related females in a troop tend to be friendly towards each other and associate closely. Otherwise, females have few friendly encounters and commonly act 
 aggressively towards each other.[48]
Females may fight for social access to males and a male may intervene.[54] Male gorillas have weak social bonds, particularly in multiple-male groups with apparent dominance hierarchies and strong competition 
for mates. Males in all-male groups, though, tend to have friendly interactions and socialise through play, grooming, and staying together,[50] and occasionally they even engage in homosexual interactions.[56] 
Severe aggression is rare in stable groups, but when two mountain gorilla groups meet the two silverbacks can sometimes engage in a fight to the death, using their canines to cause deep, gaping injuries.[57]
Quantum computing is a type of computation that harnesses the collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform calculations. The devices that perform 
quantum computations are known as quantum computers.[1]: I-5  Though current quantum computers are too small to outperform usual (classical) computers for practical applications, they are believed to be capable
 of solving certain computational problems, such as integer factorization (which underlies RSA encryption), substantially faster than classical computers.[2] The study of quantum computing is a subfield of 
 quantum information science.
There are several types of quantum computers (also known as quantum computing systems), including the quantum circuit model, quantum Turing machine, adiabatic quantum computer, one-way quantum computer, and
 various quantum cellular automata. The most widely used model is the quantum circuit, based on the quantum bit, or "qubit", which is somewhat analogous to the bit in classical computation. A qubit can be in 
 a 1 or 0 quantum state, or in a superposition of the 1 and 0 states. When it is measured, however, it is always 0 or 1; the probability of either outcome depends on the qubit's quantum state immediately prior 
 to measurement.
Efforts towards building a physical quantum computer focus on technologies such as transmons, ion traps and topological quantum computers, which aim to create high-quality qubits.[1]: 2–13  These qubits may 
be designed differently, depending on the full quantum computer's computing model, as to whether quantum logic gates, quantum annealing, or adiabatic quantum computation are employed. There are currently a 
number of significant obstacles to constructing useful quantum computers. It is particularly difficult to maintain qubits' quantum states, as they suffer from quantum decoherence and state fidelity. Quantum 
computers therefore require error correction.[3][4]
Any computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also be solved by a quantum computer.[5] Conversely, any problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a 
classical computer, at least in principle given enough time. In other words, quantum computers obey the Church–Turing thesis. This means that while quantum computers provide no additional advantages over 
classical computers in terms of computability, quantum algorithms for certain problems have significantly lower time complexities than corresponding known classical algorithms. Notably, quantum computers 
are believed to be able to quickly solve certain problems that no classical computer could solve in any feasible amount of time—a feat known as "quantum supremacy." The study of the computational complexity 
of problems with respect to quantum computers is known as quantum complexity theory.
Quantum computing began in 1980 when physicist Paul Benioff proposed a quantum mechanical model of the Turing machine.[6] Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin later suggested that a quantum computer had the potential
 to simulate things a classical computer could not feasibly do.[7][8] In 1986 Feynman introduced an early version of the quantum circuit notation.[9] In 1994, Peter Shor developed a quantum algorithm for finding 
 the prime factors of an integer with the potential to decrypt RSA-encrypted communications.[10] In 1998 Isaac Chuang, Neil Gershenfeld and Mark Kubinec created the first two-qubit quantum computer that could 
 perform computations.[11][12] Despite ongoing experimental progress since the late 1990s, most researchers believe that "fault-tolerant quantum computing [is] still a rather distant dream."[13] In recent years, 
 investment in quantum computing research has increased in the public and private sectors.[14][15] On 23 October 2019, Google AI, in partnership with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), 
 claimed to have performed a quantum computation that was infeasible on any classical computer,[16][17][18] but whether this claim was or is still valid is a topic of active research.[19][20]
A December 2021 McKinsey & Company analysis states that "..investment dollars are pouring in, and quantum-computing start-ups are proliferating". They go on to note that "While quantum computing promises to
help businesses solve problems that are beyond the reach and speed of conventional high-performance computers, use cases are largely experimental and hypothetical at this early stage."[21]
Progress in finding quantum algorithms typically focuses on this quantum circuit model, though exceptions like the quantum adiabatic algorithm exist. Quantum algorithms can be roughly categorized by the type of 
speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms.[24]
Quantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best known classical algorithm include Shor's algorithm for factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing discrete logarithms, 
solving Pell's equation, and more generally solving the hidden subgroup problem for abelian finite groups.[24] These algorithms depend on the primitive of the quantum Fourier transform. No mathematical proof has
 been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, although this is considered unlikely.[25][self-published source?] Certain oracle problems like Simon's problem and the 
 Bernstein–Vazirani problem do give provable speedups, though this is in the quantum query model, which is a restricted model where lower bounds are much easier to prove and doesn't necessarily translate to 
 speedups for practical problems.
Other problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation of certain Jones polynomials, and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of 
equations have quantum algorithms appearing to give super-polynomial speedups and are BQP-complete. Because these problems are BQP-complete, an equally fast classical algorithm for them would imply that no 
quantum algorithm gives a super-polynomial speedup, which is believed to be unlikely.[26]
Some quantum algorithms, like Grover's algorithm and amplitude amplification, give polynomial speedups over corresponding classical algorithms.[24] Though these algorithms give comparably modest quadratic 
speedup, they are widely applicable and thus give speedups for a wide range of problems.[27] Many examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems are related to Grover's algorithm, including Brassard, 
Høyer, and Tapp's algorithm for finding collisions in two-to-one functions,[28] which uses Grover's algorithm, and Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann's algorithm for evaluating NAND trees,[29] which is a variant of 
the search problem.
The most well-known example of a problem admitting a polynomial quantum speedup is unstructured search, finding a marked item out of a list of {\displaystyle n}n items in a database. This can be solved by Grover's
 algorithm using {\displaystyle O({\sqrt {n}})}O({\sqrt {n}}) queries to the database, quadratically fewer than the {\displaystyle \Omega (n)}\Omega (n) queries required for classical algorithms. In this case, 
 the advantage is not only provable but also optimal: it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups.
Problems that can be efficiently addressed with Grover's algorithm have the following properties:[37][38]
